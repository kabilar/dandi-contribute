# Contribute to DANDI repository

In this repository we collect information for people interested to contribute to DANDI project.
For instance, the [issues](https://github.com/dandi/contribute/issues) page could contain interesting ideas on how DANDI archive and overall ecosystem could be improved, but which are not necessarily on the immediate roadmap of the DANDI project teams.
Hence we would inspire community members possibly to contribute to DANDI by addressing those issues.

[DANDI Handbook](https://www.dandiarchive.org/handbook/) has a *Developer Guide* section which could be a good starting point to familiarize with DANDI internals.
